# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
Sadly, AWS GuardDuty could not detect the brute force attack after trying for a whole day.
I have documented my struggles in a Udacity Knowledge question which you may refer to through the link below:

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
According to the AWS Guard Duty documentation page, GuardDuty analyses and processes data from AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs. For detection of brute force attack, GuardDuty should be using VPC Flow Logs.
