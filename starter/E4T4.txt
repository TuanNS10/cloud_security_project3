# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Implement a WAF: A web application firewall (WAF) can be used to protect the web application from common attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). 
A WAF can also be used to enforce secure coding practices and protect against emerging threats.
WAFs are designed to sit between a client and an application to inspect application HTTP traffic and determine if the traffic patterns signify exploitation attempts. 


# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No, as the default policy of gateway endpoint allows access by any user or service within the VPC to any Amazon S3 resource.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, applying default encryption settings to an S3 bucket will not encrypt the data that already exists. 
It only applies the specified encryption settings to new objects uploaded to the bucket. 
To encrypt existing data, you will need to use a tool or process to copy the data to a new location in the bucket with the appropriate encryption settings.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
